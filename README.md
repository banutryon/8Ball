# 8Ball
Group Project with AJ


This is a simple but fun magic 8 Ball game. Simply ask the 8 Ball a question and click the ask button. You will get a random gif as an answer.

We have full crud in this app and have it hidden in plain sight. If you click on the 8 Ball in the logo you will get a drop-down that will provide some basic information about how to play the game and the option to create a new gif to add to the API.

After you ask the 8 Ball a question you can also click on the image to have another drop-down that will allow you to edit and delete the current gif.

Bellow in the footer we have also added out linked in profiles.
